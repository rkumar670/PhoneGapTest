            Lists are amazingly important to show off different things. So, these lists are
            retina too! Something for everything! Amosun Tasks New Chairmen On Service Delivery
            ** Warns Against Idleness and Mismanagement of Funds Ogun State governor, Senator
            Ibikunle Amosun, has charged the newly elected chairmen of 19 local councils in
            the state to immediately hit the ground running, noting that they have become trustees
            of the people's mandate. The governor gave the charge yesterday during the inauguration
            of 19 out of 20 newly elected local council chairmen at the June 12 Cultural Centre,
            Abeokuta. While describing the free and fair polls that produced the council heads
            last Saturday as "another great manifestation of the Ogun Standard that sets new
            benchmarks", Amosun tasked the new chairmen to justify the confidence reposed in
            them by the electorate. He urged them to bring development closer to the people
            and ensure even development of their respective Local Government Areas. While promising
            to ensure that all the local councils continue to get their due, he charged the
            council heads to devise means within the legal framework to generate funds for their
            projects. According to the governor, "It is regretful to note that while most of
            the Local Government Areas in Nigeria complain of lack of funds, they also have
            not exploited the constitutional avenues available to them to raise their own Internally
            Generated Revenue (IGR). Even where they have done so, the funds are generally mismanaged."
            He warned the chairmen against mismanagement and reckless borrowing that characterised
            the local councils during the last administration which put them in dire financial
            straits. "Funds must be prudently used for the benefit of our people at the grass-roots,"
            he said. He thanked the people of Ogun State for ensuring that there was no use
            of cudgels, cutlasses, guns and machetes, which characterised such exercise in the
            previous administration, during last Saturday's local government elections. Amosun
            commended the leadership and members of the Ogun State Independent Electoral Commission
            (OGSIEC) for conducting the first and most credible elections in the state since
            the return of civil rule in 1999. He also lauded the compliance of the electoral
            body with all court orders and praised the security agencies for discharging their
            responsibilities creditably. The Oath of Office and Oath of Allegiance were administered
            to the 19 Local Government Chairmen at exactly 11.25am by Justice Olatokunbo Olopade,
            the Chief Judge of Ogun State. The elected chairman of Imeko Afon Local Government
            could not be sworn in due to a restraining order of the court, which stopped OGSIEC
            from issuing a certificate of return in respect of the chairmanship position until
            the final determination of the case before it. Speaking on behalf of the new chairmen,
            the Chairman of Abeokuta South Local Government, Engr. Lanre Edun, thanked the people
            of the state for the confidence reposed in them and promised to join hands with
            the governor in his Mission to Rebuild Ogun State. The swearing-in ceremony was
            attended by a cross section of residents of the state; students, artisans, market
            women, community leaders, political leaders, top public officers, party loyalists,
            among others. Signed Funmi Wakama SSA (Media & Communications)</p>
